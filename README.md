# Storage_SyS

Welcome to the **Storage_SyS** repository! This project is designed to efficiently manage and organize storage systems using a well-structured, scalable architecture.

**Note:** This project is currently a work in progress.

## 📁 Project Structure

This project follows a **layered architecture (N-Tier Architecture)** to ensure clarity, maintainability, and scalability.

## 🗂 Directories

- **`config/`**: Contains configuration files for environment variables and centralized configurations.
- **`controllers/`**: Manages the request and response logic for different API routes.
- **`core/`**: Contains shared base classes such as `BaseController.ts` and `BaseService.ts` for code reusability.
- **`repositories/`**: Implements the Repository Pattern, acting as the data access layer for managing database interactions.
- **`routes/`**: Defines API endpoints and connects them with controllers.
- **`services/`**: Houses the business logic, encapsulating use cases and domain logic.
- **`models/`**: Includes Prisma ORM integration, schema definitions, and database management.
- **`middlewares/`**: Express middleware for authentication, logging, and error handling.
- **`utils/`**: Provides helper functions for logging, error handling, and other utilities.
- **`validators/`**: Contains input validation logic.
- **`logs/`**: Stores application logs for debugging and monitoring.

## 📜 Files

- **`app.ts`**: Configures the Express app and registers middlewares.
- **`server.ts`**: Initializes and starts the server.
- **`index.ts`**: The main entry point for the application.

This structure ensures the project is **modular, scalable, and maintainable**, following best practices for large-scale backend applications.
